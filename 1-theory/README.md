This task aims to check your basic knowledge of Rust and gain experience in submitting tasks.

## Task

Write answers to the questions below. Please, do not overcomplicate answers. 1-3 sentences are enough. You do not need to write an essay for every question.

2. What runtime Rust has? Does it use a GC (garbage collector)?
3. What static typing means? What are the benefits of using it?
4. What is immutability? What is the benefit of using it?
5. What are move semantics? What are borrowing rules? What is the benefit of using them?
6. What are traits? How are they used? How do they compare to interfaces?
7. What are lifetimes? Which problems do they solve?
8. What are macros? Which problems do they solve?
9. What is the difference between `&String` and `&str` types (or between `&Vec` and `&[u8]` types)? Difference between fat and thin pointers?
10. What are static and dynamic dispatches?
